# 'wake' as in 'the region of recirculating flow immediately behind a moving solid body, caused by the flow of surrounding fluid around the body' (Wikipedia), or 'the trail of a ship moving on water'

This is my second attempt at writing a simple, browser-based, strategy/economy/trading game. This time the theme could be naval, rather than cosmic. It's just because I think most ships move in a 2-D fashion, which is simpler ti implement that 3-D in space. Then again, naval vessels can crash into land or - god forbid - an iceberg, while space ships (you know, all the space ships built to this day) are kinda free to roam, so this means less collision detection, and who said I have to have 3-D space?

## Primary Project Assumptions

1. NO FLASH!
	Because I hate ActionScript, which I think is one of the silliest languages out there.
	
2. Ruby on Rails 3
	The project will use Ruby on Rails as it's 'main frame' and to conduct all database-related actions.
	
3. A lot of AJAX functionality
	It says it all - I want smoother interface and navigation where it matters.
	
4. Vector and possibly 3D graphics
	All done with HTML5, Javascript and SVG. 3D models are still just a possibility, and most likely will be limited to a in-game object viewer gizmo, but I still think it's pretty neat.
